    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>In relation to my strengths (not trying to sound arrogant in anyway whatsoever) I feel that I have good Communication skills.<br> 
         As I am always open to talking with new people especially since I am a foreigner in a place I do not kmow very well and due to that I have to learn to relate well with others.<br>
          Additional strength I think I possess is creativity. I see it as a strength particularly in my area of study. As one would need a creative mind for not only game development but also for programming.</p>
    <h2>Weakness</h2>
    <p>Many people would like to only look at and hype up their strength, however I feel it would also be ideal if people highlight their weaknessess as knowing them would help to overcome their challanges. <br>
        That being said I feel my weaknesses aren't exactly that much but the one's I can highlight are: difficulty in asking for help and inability to relate to difficult personalities.<br>
         I see those two as my most daunting weekeness due to my field of study as I know I would have to meet different types of people easpecilly during project and group works and not wanting to ask for help and or relating to difficult people  will be a great adversary to my achievements.<br>Fortunatly recognising my weaknesses at such an early stage affords me the opportunity to work on them.</p>
