    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>In realtion to my strengths (not trying to sound arrogant in anyway whatsoever) I feel that I have great Communication skills.<br> 
         As I am always open to talking with new people especially since I am a foreigner in a place I do not kmow very well and due to that I have to have great communication skills so that I do not end up lonely.<br>
          Another strength i'd like to bring up is my creavitiy and curiosity. I see my creativity and curiosity as a strength due to the filed of study I am currently embarking on as a person would need great creativity for game development and great curiosity for programming.</p>
    <h2>Weakness</h2>
    <p>Many people would like to only look at and hype up their strength, however I feel like it is also good if people highlighted their weaknessess as knowing them would help people to try their best to work on them.<br>
        That being said I feel like my weaknesses aren't exactly that much but the one's I can highlight are: difficulty in asking for help and inability to co-operate with certain personalities.<br>
         I see those two as my most daunting weekeness due to my field of study as I know I would have to meet many types of people easpecilly during project and group works and not wanting to ask for help and or co-operating with people who's personality I find questionable will be a great adversary to my achievements.</p>
